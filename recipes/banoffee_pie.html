    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>225g digestive biscuits</li>
      <li>150g butter, melted</li>
      <li>397g can caramel or 400g dulce de leche</li>
      <li>3 small bananas, sliced</li>
      <li>300ml double cream</li>
      <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
      <li>1 square dark chocolate (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <h4>STEP 1</h4>
    <p>
      Crush the digestive biscuits, either by hand using a wooden spoon, or in a
      food processor, until you get fine crumbs, tip into a bowl. <br />Mix the
      crushed biscuits with the melted butter until fully combined. Tip the
      mixture into a 23cm loose bottomed fluted tart tin and cover the tin,
      <br />including the sides, with the biscuit in an even layer. Push down
      with the back of a spoon to smooth the surface and chill for 1 hr, or
      overnight.
    </p>
    <h4>STEP 2</h4>
    <p>
      Beat the caramel to loosen and spoon it over the bottom of the biscuit
      base. Spread it out evenly using the back of a spoon or palette knife.
      <br />Gently push the chopped banana into the top of the caramel until the
      base is covered. Put in the fridge.
    </p>
    <h4>STEP 3</h4>
    <p>
      Whip the cream with the icing sugar until billowy and thick. Take the pie
      out of the fridge and spoon the whipped cream on top of the bananas.
      <br />Grate the dark chocolate over the cream, if you like, and serve.
